# 🌫️ AQI Index Analysis Dashboard Project

### An End-to-End Power BI Environmental Data Analytics Case Study

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Overview

Air Quality Index (AQI) is a critical environmental indicator that measures pollution levels and their impact on public health. This project focuses on analyzing AQI data across Indian states and cities to monitor pollution trends, identify hazardous zones, and understand pollutant contribution using **Power BI**.

The objective is to convert raw environmental data into an interactive and insight-driven dashboard that helps policymakers, researchers, and citizens make informed decisions regarding air quality management.

---

## 1.2 Objectives

The primary goals of this project are:

* Analyze overall AQI performance by state and city
* Identify primary pollutants contributing to poor air quality
* Classify air quality into standard AQI categories
* Track AQI trends over time (Year & Month analysis)
* Compare pollution levels across different regions
* Enable dynamic filtering for interactive insights

---

## 1.3 Tools & Technologies Used

* **Power BI** – Data modeling & interactive dashboard creation
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – KPI calculations & time intelligence
* **Power Query** – Data cleaning & transformation
* **Data Modeling Concepts** – Relationship building
* **Environmental KPI Classification Standards**

---

## 2. Data Understanding & Preparation

The dataset includes environmental measurements such as:

* State
* City
* Date (Year & Month)
* AQI Value
* Pollutant Levels (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃)

Data preprocessing steps included:

* Handling missing values
* Creating a proper Date table for time intelligence
* Categorizing AQI into standard health categories
* Establishing relationships between fact and dimension tables

---

## 3. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The dashboard highlights the following environmental metrics:

* **Current AQI (Delhi):** 230
* **Maximum AQI Recorded:** 435
* **Primary Pollutant:** PM2.5 & PM10
* **AQI Category:** Very Unhealthy

These KPIs provide a real-time environmental health snapshot for the selected state.

---

## 4. Business & Environmental Insights

### 4.1 State-Level Analysis

* Certain northern states consistently report higher AQI levels
* Urban-industrial zones show concentrated pollution intensity
* Map visualization helps identify high-risk regions quickly

---

### 4.2 City-Level Analysis

Top polluted cities (based on dashboard view):

* Muzaffarpur
* Patna
* Jodhpur
* Gaya
* Jaipur

These cities recorded AQI levels above 280, falling into Unhealthy or Hazardous categories.

---

### 4.3 AQI Category Distribution

AQI levels are distributed across standard classifications:

* Good (50–100)
* Moderate (101–150)
* Poor (151–200)
* Unhealthy (201–250)
* Very Unhealthy (251–300)
* Hazardous (301–500)

Majority observations fall under Poor and Unhealthy ranges, indicating significant environmental concern.

---

### 4.4 Pollutant Occurrence Frequency

* **PM2.5** shows the highest occurrence frequency
* **PM10** follows closely
* Gaseous pollutants (NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃) show comparatively lower dominance

This confirms that particulate matter is the primary driver of air quality deterioration.

---

### 4.5 AQI Trend Over Time

* Seasonal spikes are visible in specific months
* Winter months show higher AQI levels (possible impact of smog & temperature inversion)
* Time intelligence analysis allows year-wise comparison

---

## 5. Impact & Use Case

### Key Findings

* Particulate matter (PM2.5 & PM10) is the dominant pollutant
* Several Tier 2 & Tier 3 cities show severe pollution levels
* AQI frequently crosses the "Very Unhealthy" threshold
* Pollution trend patterns suggest seasonal environmental risks

---

## 6. Recommendations

✅ Implement stricter emission control in high-risk states
✅ Promote public awareness in severely affected cities
✅ Encourage green mobility & industrial regulation
✅ Monitor winter season pollution spikes more aggressively
✅ Develop early-warning AQI alert systems

---

## 7. Conclusion

This AQI Index Analysis project demonstrates how environmental data can be transformed into a powerful analytical dashboard using Power BI. By combining data modeling, pollutant analysis, and time intelligence, the dashboard provides actionable environmental insights that support health-conscious and policy-driven decisions.

The project highlights the importance of data-driven environmental monitoring in managing urban pollution challenges effectively.
